## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

A proactive, dynamic, and creative **Full Stack Software Developer** by day. A music, [film](https://github.com/jasylwong/wepick) and pizza aficionado by night.

Previously in my career, I qualified as an [actuary](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/become-actuary/what-actuary) (a globally recognised qualification renowned for being particularly arduous and having a high drop out rate). I then became attracted to software development by its potential to be applied in all manners of fields, including e-commerce, fraud detection, and medical healthcare. Furthermore, I enjoy working in industries that are continually progressing, and where there is always the chance to learn something new. 

I would like to work at a company that also shares my goal of moving the world forward and creating real, tangible benefits for society. Having now graduated from Makers, I am eager to use my driven nature, analytical mind, and rapidly developing tech skills to help them achieve this.
