## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I'm a determined, passionate, and curious **Full Stack Software Developer**, looking to join a company on an exciting journey where I can use my skills and knowledge to help create innovative and meaningful solutions, make a real impact while making a positive contribution to the team and the company.

I have been studying at Makers Academy since August 2022 where I learned the fundamentals of software development, it's where I realised my passion and natural apptitude for coding. My analytical mind, curiosity fuels my desire to gain a deep understanding of various programming languages and frameworks and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.
