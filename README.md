## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I'm a determined, passionate, and curious **Full Stack Software Developer**, looking to join a company on an exciting journey where I can use my skills and knowledge to help create innovative and meaningful solutions. I would like to make a real impact while making a positive contribution to the team and the company.
After years of searching for my passion, I came across coding and quickly realized the potential, the challenge, the ability to use this skill to have a positive impact on people's lives. Finally, my search had ended. 
I have been studying at Makers Academy since August 2022 where I learned the fundamentals of software development, it's where I realized my natural aptitude for coding. My analytical mind and curiosity which fuels my desire to gain a deeper understanding of various programming languages and frameworks and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Fast Learner, time management skills ####
- During Makers, I learnt Node.js, Express, React and MongoDB while building a social media site in a few weeks, without being taught during the course and no prior experience.
- During my transition from Senior Interviewer to Supervisor, I had to develop many soft skills in a short amount of time in order to lead a team effectively.
- In one of the busiest cities in the world, the London bus network is one the main forms of transport and needs to meet a strict timetable to ensure London continues to move, I had to ensure I stuck to the timetable even when faced with challenging scenarios.

#### Analytical thinker, high level of concentration ####
- I have a desire to understand relevant coding concepts in detail and also writing creative, clean code.
- While coding, I demonstrate a high level of concentration, this is my comfort zone. I actively seek challenging tickets during a project so I can demonstrate my analytical approach.
- During stand ups, when issues are brought up which is preventing a team member from completing a ticket, I‚Äôm quick to offer assistance to try and help identify and resolve the issue.

#### Leadership, communication ####
- During my Supervisor role in Network Research, I was in charge of ensuring a team of telephone interviewers met survey targets hourly by keeping track of statistical data. If a target wasn't met, we had to arrange a plan and I had to make sure my team was motivated throughout to meet the target. If it was long term productivity issue, I had to conduct a performance review to figure out a long term strategy.
- Throughout projects in Makers, I took a team leader role to ensure we completed tickets and met the deadline to present our projects.
- In the early stages of my Supervisor role, I was thrown into the deep at the start. I was based in the London call center, which is in charge of all call centers. When I was left alone and an IT failure occurred, it was my responsibility to repair the issue or productivity will be affected massively. I had to take control, communicate with many different departments while leading the repair
